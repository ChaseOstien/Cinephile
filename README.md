# Team-5-Project
In this project we as a group are assigned to make a(n) application that:
Uses a bootstrap alternative like Tailwind or Bulma
Is very interactive to users looking for a certain type of information
The application is to pull 2 different server side APIs
Uses the users side storage or local storage to store information that they can go back to
The application is be responsive to the sizing of the users usage of the data wheter they are viewing it thru a laptop computer, phone or tablet
The application is to be presentable and easy for the user to use
The repository is to be clean and presentable meaning the that the commits are quality meaning that they are thought thru
Each group member sends commits to show that they helped with the project

This application that we created is called Cinephile, the meaning of the word is to define someone who is commited to all things movie like. Wheter it is news articles about a movie they are wanting to see and seeing if its good or maybe they are wanting small details of an upcoming movie without being spoiled we have it all in this app for your "one stop shop" needs. In the top half of the application is where you will see articles, reviews and such of the movie you typed in into the search bar. The bottom right half of the application is where movie details of the movie you typed in will be shown. And the bottom left side of the application is where your previous looked movies will be shown for future refernce to go back to if you need it. All this information being pulled from well known websites like rotten tomatoes and IMDB.
