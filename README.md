# Cinephile

## Description

This is a movie application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bulma, an open source CSS framework. It uses two separate API calls, one to Flixster and the other to The Open Movie Database.

A cinephile is "a person who is fond of" movies. With that in mind, the Cinephile app has two basic features. 

The user:

- will see movie-related articles at the top of their screen 
- can type the title of a movie they are curious about into the search box to learn more about it

Through making Cinephile we:

- gained experience making API calls
- became familiar with the basics of Bulma 
- learned to collaborate on a group project
